# Purpose and Scope

This folder defines the **AI Development Contract**: a minimal, high-signal set of rules that ensures safe, predictable, high-quality collaboration between humans and AI agents.

The contract establishes:
- **How AI should behave** in planning, design, coding, analysis, and refactoring.
- **How work is structured** through a shared, multi-phase workflow.
- **How quality, security, and git hygiene** are enforced consistently.
- **How context is maintained**, updated, and compiled across projects.
- **How local and global rules interact**, including project-specific overrides.

The `00_` series contains **the highest-priority rules**.  
These rules are always read first, always apply, and override everything else.

This contract is optimized for:
- AI agents working in multi-step pipelines.
- Teams needing consistent behavior across repositories.
- Scenarios where token budget is limited and clarity matters.

Stack-specific examples may appear in lower-priority folders but are always **adapted**, never ignored.
