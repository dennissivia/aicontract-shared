# AI Context Maintenance

## Before Starting Work
- Re-read the `.aicontract` documents before any significant task or code change.
- Make this the first TODO item when planning work so the rules stay fresh.
- Use this folder as the anchor after any conversation/context refresh.

## After Learning New Preferences
- Update the relevant contract file immediately to keep this folder the single source of truth.
- Place priority rules in `00_20_mandatory-rules.md`; add detailed explanations in the appropriate topical file.
- Maintain the heading and numbering structure when adding or editing content.
