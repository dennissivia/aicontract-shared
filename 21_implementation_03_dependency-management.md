# Dependency Management

## Adding Dependencies
- Check Maven Central for actual versions before adding.
- Verify dependencies are free of known CVEs.
- Keep dependencies up to date and document why each addition is needed.

## Dependency Updates
- Use simple commit messages for routine updates; structured commits only when an update enables a new feature.
- Run tests after updating dependencies.
